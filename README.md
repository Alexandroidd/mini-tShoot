# Rapid Troubleshooting

So let's talk about Steve.  Nobody liked Steve.  He would push a whole bunch of new code to GitHub on Friday at 430, and then walk out the door, not stopping to see that all of his code broke the site in unrecoverable ways.  To be fair, we have all done things like this every once in a while, but this time is different.  Steve flipped off the boss and said, "Burning Man forever!" on his way out the door.

Looks like Steve's code problems are now our code problems.  Giving new meaning to the phrase "you are not your code".  Our customers most certainly think we are Steve's code, and we should fix as much as possible before we get in trouble.

It is **highly encouraged** to use your Developer Tools' Elements and Console tabs to debug these issues.

Here are all the problems our customers are complaining about, see how many you can solve:

### To Fix

1. The header used to be centered, but now it is all the way on the left.  This is scaring our users.  Can you figure out why this style is not applying?
1. Our header used to be blue and gray but now it is a boring black and white.  Our users would like it to go back to the way it used to be.  Can you figure out why the color is not applying?
1. Why doesn't our "See our Projects" button work?  Our users would like to see some projects that we have built.  There may be a couple problems to solve here.
1. Why do all of our project images look the same?  Our users don't like this, they want to see four different project images.

### Bonus

1. Steve thinks he's funny, and sent our users to `ZomboCom` when they click on any of our projects.  As hilarious as this is, please have them redirect to one of your GitHub repos so our users can see our work.
2. These color swatches aren't very helpful.  Please use images from your portfolio that better capture our WDI work.
